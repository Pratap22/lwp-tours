      title: 'What is the Sustainable Development Fee (SDF)?',
      content: 'The SDF is a daily levy paid by visitors to support Bhutan\'s development. For most tourists, it is $100 USD per person per night. This fee helps fund public services like healthcare and education, maintain infrastructure, and support conservation efforts, ensuring tourism benefits the entire country sustainably.'

      title: 'Do I need a guide?',
      content: 'Yes, with very few exceptions, all tourists must be accompanied by a licensed Bhutanese guide. This ensures you have a safe, smooth, and enriching experience, and it is a key part of Bhutan\'s high-value, low-impact tourism policy.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Is Bhutan safe for solo female travelers?',
      content: 'Absolutely. Bhutan is one of the safest countries in the world, with a very low crime rate. Solo female travelers often report feeling incredibly safe and respected. Your guide will also ensure your safety and comfort throughout your journey.'
    },
    {
        title: 'What is the food like?',
        content: 'Bhutanese cuisine is unique and delicious, known for its spicinessâ€”especially the use of chilies. The national dish is "Ema Datshi" (chilies and cheese). However, tourist hotels and restaurants offer a wide range of continental, Indian, and Chinese dishes to suit all palates. Vegetarian and vegan options are widely available.'
    },
    {
        title: 'What is the internet and mobile connectivity like?',
        content: 'Mobile connectivity is widespread in most of Bhutan, with 4G available in major towns. You can buy a local SIM card upon arrival. Wi-Fi is available in most tourist-standard hotels, though it may be slower than what you\'re used to. It\'s perfect for staying in touch, but not always for heavy data usage.'
